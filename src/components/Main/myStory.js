            <h3>Desiree Morris</h3>
            <p>Entrepreneur & Full Stack Web Developer With an Eye For Design</p>
            <p>I first taught myself how to code when I was 12 years old after my grandmother introduced 
                me to web development in the 90s. I used it mostly as a hobby as I met people in chat rooms 
                and participated in web design and graphic design challenges. Eventually I went to college 
                and majored in Entrepreneurship and Graphic Design</p>
            <p>At Western Carolina University I landed my first job as a Junior Web Designer for 
                the University’s Website. I also became the go to person for student organizations, and 
                department specific websites. After 3 years I left that job and transferred to a different school.  
                I graduated with my bachelor’s degree in biology and began working in the medical field.
                During that time I went back to building websites for friends and family as a hobby.</p>
            <p>In 2018, I decided to leave my medical career behind and get serious about my first love, 
                Web Development.  For a year I freelanced for small businesses.  During that time I 
                decided I wanted to learn more and become a Full Stack Web Developer. I began looking for ways 
                to increase and modernize my skill set when I decided to enroll in Lambda School. </p>
            <p>Lambda School is a 6+ month Computer Science & Software Engineering Academy.  I enrolled in the 
                9 month Web Development & Computer Science track that provided me with an immersive hands-on 
                curriculum.</p>
